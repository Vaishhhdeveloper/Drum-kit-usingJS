# Drum-kit-usingJS
Hi There!!!
This is a drum kit developed using javascript.
How to use it?
when you open this website, you can see 7 images displayed with some letters such as w a s d and so on....
you can play the drum sounds in the website!!
To do this, you can click the images or you can press the respective keys on your keyboard. For example, if the image displays the letter "w" then press W to hear the sound.
Thank you!!
